Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of Uber ride data to gain insights into various aspects, including the busiest months, traffic patterns, and the most active Uber vehicles. The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Getting Started
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/dhakshan751/Uber_Data_analysis.git
cd Uber_Data_analysis
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Uber_Data_Analysis-checkpoint.ipynb
Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the Uber data analysis.

Data Loading and Cleaning
The analysis begins with loading Uber ride data from CSV files. The data cleaning process includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.

python
Copy code
# Importing Required Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 
import plotly.graph_objs as go
import plotly.express as px
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
import os

# Read Uber ride data
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Internships\Udemy\Uber_anaysis\Datasets\uber-raw-data-janjune-15.csv")
df1 = pd.read_csv('uber-raw-data-janjune-15_sample.csv')

# Data Cleaning
# (Include code snippets for handling missing values, duplicates, and changing data types)
Analysis
1. Identify the Busiest Month for Uber Pickups
The analysis includes visual representations of the monthly pickup frequencies using bar and pie plots.

python
Copy code
# Analyzing the busiest month
df1['Month'] = df1['Pickup_date'].dt.month_name()
month_frequency = df1['Month'].value_counts()

# Visual representation
month_frequency.plot(kind='bar')
# (Include other visualizations if needed)
2. Traffic Patterns by Hour and Weekday
The analysis explores traffic patterns by hour and weekday, providing insights into when Uber pickups are most active.

python
Copy code
# Analyzing traffic patterns
hourly_pickup = df1.groupby(['Weekdays', 'hours']).size().reset_index(name='size')

# Visual representation using seaborn pointplot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.pointplot(x='hours', y='size', hue='Weekdays', data=hourly_pickup)
# (Include conclusions drawn from the analysis)
3. Identify the Most Active Uber Vehicle
The project includes a thorough analysis of active Uber vehicles using box plots and violin plots.

python
Copy code
# Analyzing active Uber vehicles
df3 = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Internships\Udemy\Uber_anaysis\Datasets\Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv")

# Box plot using Plotly
box = px.box(x='dispatching_base_number', y='active_vehicles', data_frame=df3, color='dispatching_base_number')
box.show()

# Violin plot using Plotly
color_map = {'base_number1': 'red', 'base_number2': 'blue', 'base_number3': 'green'}
violin = px.violin(df3, x='dispatching_base_number', y='active_vehicles', color='dispatching_base_number', color_discrete_map=color_map)
violin.show()
# (Include any additional insights or conclusions)
4. Heatmap of Uber Pickups
The project visualizes the distribution of Uber pickups in New York City using a heatmap.

python
Copy code
# Heatmap of Uber pickups
import folium
from folium.plugins import HeatMap

# Creating a basemap
Basemap = folium.Map()

# Adding a heatmap layer
HeatMap(Rush).add_to(Basemap)
Basemap
# (Include any insights or observations from the heatmap)
5. Pairwise Analysis
The project concludes with a pairwise analysis, allowing users to customize and explore their own pivot tables.

python
Copy code
# Pairwise Analysis
def gen_pivot_table(df, c1, c2):
    pivot = final.groupby(['day', 'hour']).size().unstack()
    return pivot.style.background_gradient()

gen_pivot_table(final, 'day', 'hour')
# (Include any observations or conclusions from the pairwise analysis)
Conclusion
The Uber Data Analysis project provides valuable insights into Uber ride patterns, traffic trends, and active vehicles. Users can leverage the provided code and visualizations for further exploration and analysis. Feel free to contribute or customize the analysis based on your specific needs.
